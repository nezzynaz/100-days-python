# 100 Days of Code - Python

This is a collection of code I've written for the 100 days of Code Python Bootcamp on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). Not everything is included, and everything else are things I found important. Maybe it will help you or give inspiration. ðŸ™‚

## Highlights
- "Nezzy's People's Favorite Places" on day 9
- The Beehives "High or Low" game on day 12

## Things to (maybe) return to
- Blackjack game on day 11

## My review of the course
