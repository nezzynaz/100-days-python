#name = input("What is your name?")
#print(name)

# print(len(input("What is your name?"))) A line that takes input, counts how long it is, and prints it.

username = input("What is your name?")
length = len(username)
print(length)

# this does the same thing as the single line, but splitting the code up into smaller modules makes it easier to understand.
