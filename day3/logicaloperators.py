'''Notes on Logical Operators in Python'''
# Oh God not this again.

# Examples include:
# A and B
# C or D
# not B

# If true and false are being tested, it will always default to true if true is in the query.

# I'm sure you remember these.

A = 12
TEST = A > 10 and A < 13
print(TEST)
